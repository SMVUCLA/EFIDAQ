Signal Transmission Interface
	At least 1 byte sent over Serial
	First byte is signal identifiers
		This should be a 1 byte number (0 to 255)
	All further bytes should be reserved for value transmission
	Signal IDs (as of now):
		0: Arduino Reset
		1: Start Sending Data
		2: Stop Sending Data
		3: Synchronize
		4: Update Arduino's AFR Table
		5: Update DAQ's AFR Table
		6: Set Idle Fuel Ratio
		7: Set Current Fuel Ratio
		8: Set Reset Fuel Ratio
		9: Set Desired RPM
		10: Set Desired O2
		
	Order of Parameters Sent Over Serial
		36 bytes
		All Values are 4 bytes long

		time (unsigned long)
		totalRevolutions (unsigned long)
		ECT (float)
		IAT (float)
		MAP (float)
		TPS (float)
		OIN (float)
		totalPulseTime (float)
		RPM (signed long)

	Sending/Receiving AFR Table
		First byte is ID (4 or 5) for sending or receiving
		Second byte is for number of rows (0 to 255)
		Third byte is for number of columns (0 to 255)
		Each subsequent 4 bytes will be the value for the given table slot
			This means that the first set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,0), the second set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,1), and so on.
			Once the first row is filled up, the values start to refer to the second row.
