Signal Transmission Interface
	At least 1 byte sent over Serial
	First byte is signal identifiers
		This should be a 1 byte number (0 to 255)
	All further bytes should be reserved for value transmission
	Signal IDs (as of now):
		0: Arduino Reset
		1: Start Sending Data
		2: Stop Sending Data
		3: Synchronize Parameter Order
		4: Update Arduino's AFR Table
		5: Update DAQ's AFR Table
		6: Set Idle Fuel Ratio
		7: Set Current Fuel Ratio
		8: Set Reset Fuel Ratio
		9: Set Desired RPM
		10: Set Desired O2
	Synchronized Parameter Order
		Signal should be of the following form
			1st byte should be the signal ID
			Each subsequent byte is the ID of the given parameter
			What does this mean?
				the initial byte (3) is the signal identifier which identifies this as the command to synchronize the parameter order
				After that, each byte refers to a given parameter to be transmitted
				By changing the order of these parameter IDs, we can change the order in which these parameters are transmitted over serial
			Parameter IDs:
				0: Time in seconds with 4 decimal points of precision
				1: ECT
				2: IAT
				3: MAP
				4: TPS
				5: OIN
				6: RPM
			Example:
				"31234560" would print data in the order ECT, IAT, MAP, TPS, OIN, RPM, Time
	Sending/Receiving AFR Table
		First byte is ID (4 or 5) for sending or receiving
		Second byte is for number of rows (0 to 255)
		Third byte is for number of columns (0 to 255)
		Each subsequent 4 bytes will be the value for the given table slot
			This means that the first set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,0), the second set of 4 bytes will refer to table position (0,1), and so on.
			Once the first row is filled up, the values start to refer to the second row.
