Signal Transmission Interface
	At least 2 bytes sent over Serial
	First 2 bytes are signal identifiers
		This should be a 2 digit number (00 to 99)
	All further bytes should be reserved for value transmission
	Signal IDs (as of now):
		00: Arduino Reset
		01: Start Sending Data
		02: Stop Sending Data
		03: Synchronize Parameter Order (details below)
		04: Update Arduino's AFR Table
		05: Update DAQ's AFR Table
		06: Set Idle Fuel Ratio
		07: Set Current Fuel Ratio
		08: Set Reset Fuel Ratio
		09: Set Desired RPM
		10: Set Desired O2
	Synchronized Parameter Order
		Signal should be in the form "0300010203040506"
			What does this mean?
				the initial 03 is the signal identifier which identifies this as the command to synchronize the parameter order
				After that, each set of two digits refers to a given parameter to be transmitted
				By changing the order of these parameter IDs, we can change the order in which these parameters are transmitted over serial
			Parameter IDs:
				00: Time in seconds with 4 decimal points of precision
				01: ECT
				02: IAT
				03: MAP
				04: TPS
				05: OIN
				06: RPM
			Example:
				"0301020304050600" would print data in the order ECT, IAT, MAP, TPS, OIN, RPM, Time
