List of items that are on the TODO list for the DAQ system

IN PROGRESS 1) Make button for opening the AFR Table during testing open a new window showing a full
    AFR Table. There should be a button that, when clicked, will instruct the arduino to
    update its onboard AFR table to have the values listed in the table in the program.
1) Need to make the arduino synchronize the order of its data output to the order
    shown in the xListview and yListview which show all the available axis labels.
    This can be done by having a signal sent to the arduino when the start data collection
    button is clicked that has the arduino send a quick .csv message to the DAQ system
    which can be loaded into the xlistview and ylistview before starting data collection.
2) Make testsetup window able to communicate parameters and the AFR Table values to the
    arduino via a button that can be clicked.
3) Need a button that can send a signal to the Arduino to reset itself.
4) If the data collection is repeatedly started and stopped, bad bytes come through. Need
     to find a way to get rid of the bad bytes before they are printed to the screen.
5) Need to make input filter toggle-able. This is the filter that only accepts input that has
     the correct number of fields.
Basically Done 6) Need to make it so that it only prompts the user to save before exiting if the data has been changed at all
    since the last save.
Basically Done 7) Need to make it so that clearing the data stream when it is empty does nothing.
In Progress 8) Need to specify the file types it can save as when saving. ex: *.csv, *.txt etc...
9) When the data stream is unlocked and clicked at all, it needs to know that it needs to
    set the cursor back to the very bottom before writing any more data to it otherwise the
    data will be written to the wrong place.
IN PROGRESS 10) Need to implement a menu option that has a full list of signals that can be sent to the controller.
11) Need the ability to view all the parameters stored on the Arduino. This should be in a window.
COMPLETED 12) Automaticaly close Air to Fuel Ratio Table upon Runtest window closing.
13) If the user has their cursor on a plot it should display the plot coordinates of the point the cursor is pointing to.
14) Need to make the WrappingQVector class automatically sort when data is inserted. This may improve
    performance for plotting because the QCustomPlot class internally sorts the data every time new data is added.
15) Need to reorganize the code and user interfaces.
