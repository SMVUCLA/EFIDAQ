List of items that are on the TODO list for the DAQ system

1) Fix bug causing system to crash if data collection is stopped and then started again.
2) Make QCustomPlot plotting have a toggle box for connecting data points by lines or not.
3) Make button for opening the AFR Table during testing open a new window showing a full
    AFR Table. There should be a button that, when clicked, will instruct the arduino to
    update its onboard AFR table to have the values listed in the table in the program.
4) Need to make thr arduino synchronize the order of its data output to the order
    shown in the xListview and yListview which show all the available axis labels.
    This can be done by having a signal sent to the arduino when the start data collection
    button is clicked that has the arduino send a quick .csv message to the DAQ system
    which can be loaded into the xlistview and ylistview before starting data collection.
5) Make QCustomPlot window have an option which allows the user to dynamically choose
    how many points to keep on the plot at a time.
6) Make testsetup window able to communicate parameters and the AFR Table values to the
    arduino via a button that can be clicked.
7) Need to implement a button on the runtest window that can clear out the data currently
    held on the DataViewer.
8) Need to rename the "mainwindow" class and filenames for QCustomPlot stuff to something
    meaningful.
9) Need to implement a button for saving the data currently held in the dataview to a .csv file.
10) Need to button that can send a signal to the Arduino to reset itself.
11) Need to change all the windows to mainwindows in order to make use of the increased functionality.
12) If the data collection is repeatedly started and stopped, bad bytes come through. Need
     to find a way to get rid of the bad bytes before they are printed to the screen.
13) Need to make input filter toggle-able. This is the filter that only accepts input that has
     the correct number of fields.
14) Need to reimplement closeEvent for RUNTEST window in order to ask if the user wants to save
     the data in the databrowser before closing the windows. Also need to properly close the
     serial port in case it is open. Also need to make sure the plotting window is properly
     closed in the event that the RUNTEST window is closed.
